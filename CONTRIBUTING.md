# Contributing to Awesome DevSecOps

First off, thank you for taking the time to contribute! It's people like you who make this list awesome.

When contributing, please pull request your changes to the `main` branch.

## How can I contribute?

### Adding a new tool
If you find a great DevSecOps tool that isn't on the list:
1. **Check if it's already there**: Use `Cmd+F` or `Ctrl+F` to search the list.
2. **Quality matters**: Ensure the tool is actively maintained or widely recognized in the security industry.
3. **Format your entry**: Use the following format:
   `- [Tool Name](Link) - Short description starting with a capital letter and ending with a period.`

### Reporting a broken link
If you find a link that no longer works, please open an [Issue](https://github.com).

## Contribution Guidelines

- **English only**: Please keep the descriptions in English for consistency.
- **Categorization**: Place the tool in the most appropriate existing category. If you think a new category is needed, please mention it in your PR.
- **No duplicates**: Do not add a tool that is already listed.
- **Clean PRs**: Make sure your pull request title is descriptive (e.g., "Add Snyk to SCA section").

2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b add-my-tool`).
3. Make your changes in `README.md`.
4. Commit your changes (`git commit -m 'Add ToolName'`).
